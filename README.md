# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## 1. Installing and launching the frontend app

### 1.1 Prerequisites
NodeJS (version 16.16.0)
npm
If you are working with several versions of NodeJS, I recommend you install nvm. This tool will allow you to easily manage your NodeJS versions.
### 1.2 Installing the frontend
Fork this repo (see https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), then clone it (see https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
When these steps are done, open your terminal on VSCode.
Change your directory to the name of the cloned folder.

For example, if folder name is "my-new-app".
### 1.3 Launching the frontend

Make sure the previous steps are successful.

Then, if not already done, install and launch the backend API on port 3001.
npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
